 * removed needless check in get_md5sum looking for common slack mirror
   directories.
 * Prompt to upgrade before downloading (thanks kyotou)
 * updated FAQ with dropline question, and upgrade single package question
 * options can now be passed in in any order, so --no-prompt at the end now
   works

   updates and newer available at once, simplified --install and --upgrade
   part of roadmap to package action transactions.
