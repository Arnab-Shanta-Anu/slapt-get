 * Makefile updates
 * more Makefile updates, symlinking libslapt-$(VERSION).so to libslapt.so

0.9.7b Nov 10, 2003
 * removed --interactive option
 * download all pkgs before processing installs,upgrades, and removals in transaction

 * give transaction report prompt for every dist-upgrade (even if no removes or upgrades,
   must have installs, however)
 * updated regex for pkg names, versions, md5, etc
 * when looking up md5 checksum, use the pkg location as well as name and version 
   (in case of duplicate versions)
 * updated regex, yet again, for pkg names, versions, md5, etc

   version to be checked, instead of just the name during the initial upgrade check)
   This is useful for excluding versions that contain pre or beta with a regex in the
   exclude such as: [0-9\_\.\-]{1}pre[0-9\-\.\-]{1} or [0-9\_\.\-]{1}beta[0-9\-\.\-]{1}

   using lookup_pkg_dependencies and parse_dep_entry functions
 * make pkg now gzip's the manpage and strips the binary (thanks Jim)
 * added search_transaction function
 * exit on unknown command line switch instead of barking usage info
   and going on
 * added is_required_by function, so --remove pkg also prompts to remove
   packages (recursively) that require it

   (see example.slapt-getrc or README/FAQ)
