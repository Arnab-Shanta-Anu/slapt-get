 1. Features

    slapt-get tries to emulate Debian's apt-get as closely as possible.

    * uses native Slackware tools (installpkg, upgradepkg, and removepkg)
    * supports multiple package sources (including linuxpackages.net)
    * cache data concerning packages and updates from package sources
    * supports sources from ftp, ftps, http, https, file:/// and more (libcurl)
    * resumes broken downloads and will verify package integrity with MD5
      checksum
    * show packages that are available (from cached data) and installed
    * search package listing using POSIX and extended regular expressions
      by package name, location, and description
    * retrieve, install, and remove packages by name or by specific version
    * retrieve and apply updates
    * upgrade from one slackware release to another in a few simple steps
    * show description of packages, including mirror location, version, size,
      dependencies (where available), conflicts (where available), description,
      and installation status
    * exclude (hold) packages from upgrades, by name or by regular expression
    * transaction engine for install, remove, and upgrades
    * "compare package version" algorithm to prevent downgrades
    * recursive dependency resolution using slack-required metadata (see FAQ)
    * extremely fast and easy to script with



 2. Requirements

    slapt-get requires Slackware-9.0 or better, due to glibc and openssl
    updates.  You can also use slapt-get under Slackware 8.1 if you
    upgrade glibc-solibs and openssl from Slackware 9.0, or if slapt-get
    is built statically linked.

    The following packages are required to build slapt-get from source:
    make, gcc, curl, glibc, kernel-headers, binutils, zlib, gettext-tools,
    and openssl



 3. Installation

    See INSTALL.



 4. slapt-getrc

    The slapt-getrc file consists currently of the following keys:
     SOURCE
     WORKINGDIR
     EXCLUDE

    Choose mirror from slackware.com mirror list:
    lynx -source http://www.slackware.com/getslack/|grep -i href \
     |awk -F "HREF=" '{print $2}'|cut -f2 -d'"'

    * SOURCE must be a path to a valid slackware release directory,
    or a source such as linuxpackages.net (see example within rc).
    All that is required is the PACKAGES.TXT (see FAQ entry #17)
    and CHECKSUMS.md5.  Multiple sources can be defined.

      NOTE: It is not recommended to mix 3rd party package sources
            with the official on production servers.  Sometimes 
            third party sources contain the same packages as the
            official mirrors. Third party packages might not be
            as rigorously tested as official packages.

    * WORKINGDIR will hold the package data and downloaded packages.
      This directory will have to be created.

    * EXCLUDE is a comma seperated list of pkgs you want excluded from
    updating. This can be the package name, or a extended POSIX regex.
    For example, to exclude dropline, use .*-dl$


 5. Troubleshooting

   Probably lots of bugs.  email bug reports to me:
    Jason Woodward <woodwardj at jaos dot org>

   or directly to the mailing lists:
    slapt-get-user at software dot jaos dot org
    slapt-get-devel at software dot jaos dot org

   Make sure --update is ran once initially and the data file (package_data)
   is good.

   Some mirrors are incomplete and the downloaded file is actually html
   specifying the webservers error message.  MD5 checking has been 
   incorporated in order to alleviate this problem.

   Please do not add redundant mirror locations to the same release.  Mirror
   fallback is not implemented.  Also, any time the source url(s) are
   changed, slapt-get --update must be run to update local cache.

   If you are getting segfaults, add -g to CFLAGS in the Makefile, change the
   DEBUG define in src/main.h to 1, and rebuild ( make clean && make ).  Run
   in gdb and let me know via email where the fault happens.

   See the FAQ for more info.
