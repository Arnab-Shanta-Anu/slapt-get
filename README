 1. Features

    slapt-get tries to emulate Debian's apt-get as closely as possible.

    * cache package data and update data from mirror site
    * show packages that are available (from cached data)
    * allow packages to be retrieved and installed by name
    * allow updates to be retrieved and applied (frontent to updatepkg)
    * show description of packages
    * list installed packages
    * remove packages (frontent to removepkg)
    * dist-upgrade from one slackware release to another
    * exclude (hold) packages from upgrades



 2. Requirements

    slapt-get requires glibc-2.3.1 (slackware9 or better) due to 
    the regex.h updates. 

    The following packages are required to build slapt-get:
    make, gcc, curl, glibc, kernel-headers, binutils, zlib, and openssl



 3. Installation

    See INSTALL.



 4. slapt-getrc

    The slapt-getrc file consists currently of the following keys:
     SOURCE
     WORKINGDIR
     EXCLUDE

    Choose mirror from slackware.com mirror list:
    lynx -source http://www.slackware.com/getslack/|grep -i href \
     |awk -F "HREF=" '{print $2}'|cut -f2 -d'"'

    The SOURCE must be a path to a valid slackware release directory,
    or a source such as linuxpackages.net (see example within rc).
    Multiple sources can be defined.  Please do not add redundant
    mirror locations to the same release.  Mirror fallback is not
    yet implemented.

    WORKINGDIR will hold the package data and downloaded packages.

    EXCLUDE is a comma seperated list of pkgs you want excluded from
    updating.



 5. Troubleshooting

   Probably lots of bugs.  email bug reports to me:
    Jason Woodward <woodwardj at jaos dot org>

   Make sure --update is ran once initially and downloaded *_list files are
   good.

   Some mirrors are incomplete and the downloaded file is actually html
   specifying the webservers error message.  MD5 checking has been 
   incorporated in order to alleviate this problem.

   If you are getting segfaults, add -g to CFLAGS in the Makefile, change the
   DEBUG define in src/main.h to 1, and rebuild ( make clean && make ).  Run
   in gdb and let me know via email where the fault happens.

   See the FAQ for more info.

 6. Thanks and contributions

   with documentation suggestions and feature requests.

   Thanks to James Simmons over at linuxpackages.net for his interest, support,
