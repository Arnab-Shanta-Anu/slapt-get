 1. Features

    Jaospkg tries to emulate Debian's apt-get as closely as possible.

    * cache package data and update data from mirror site
    * show packages that are available (from cached data)
    * allow packages to be retrieved and installed by name
    * allow updates to be retrieved and applied (frontent to updatepkg)
    * show description of packages
    * list installed packages
    * remove packages (frontent to removepkg)
    * --dist-upgrade from one slackware release to another
    * exclude packages from upgrades



 2. Requirements

    The following packages are required: make, gcc, curl, glibc,
    kernel-headers, binutils, zlib, and openssl

 3. Installation

    See INSTALL.



 4. jaospkgrc

    The jaospkgrc file consists currently of the following keys:
     MIRROR
     WORKINGDIR

    Choose mirror from slackware.com mirror list:
    lynx -source http://www.slackware.com/getslack/|grep -i href \
     |awk -F "HREF=" '{print $2}'|cut -f2 -d'"'

    The MIRROR must be a path to a valid slackware release directory.

    WORKINGDIR will hold the package data and downloaded packages.

    EXCLUDE is a comma seperated list of pkgs you want excluded from
    updating.



 5. Troubleshooting

   Probably lots of bugs.  email bug reports to me:
    Jason Woodward <woodwardj at jaos dot org>

   Make sure --update is ran and downloaded *_list files are good.

   Some mirrors are incomplete and the downloaded file is actually html specifying
    the webservers error message.  Run --clean to purge tgz files within WORKINGDIR.
