slapt-get is pretty feature complete.  At the moment, bug fixes are the most important.

Future enhancements, fixes, or features:

 * fix broken pkg description (someone who knows what they are doing help)
 * find memory leaks
 * file check before downloading pkg (don't download twice, incorp md5sum checking maybe)
 * source pkg handling (maybe)
 * dependancy tracking (ideally that will happen in PACKAGES.TXT)
 * multiple sources/mirrors (merge package data into one local PACKAGES.TXT)
