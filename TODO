slapt-get is pretty feature complete.  At the moment, bug fixes are the most important.

Future enhancements, fixes, or features:

 * multiple sources/mirrors (merge package data into one local PACKAGES.TXT)
 * curses/gtk frontend

 * optimize
 * add more error checking/handling, remove some exit() calls
 * find memory leaks

 * dependancy tracking (ideally that will happen in PACKAGES.TXT)
 * source pkg handling (maybe)
