slapt-get is pretty feature complete.  At the moment, bug fixes are the most important.

Future enhancements, fixes, or features:

 * find cause of segfault in packages.c (when calloc's turned to malloc)
 * file check before downloading pkg (don't download twice, incorp md5sum checking)
 * source pkg handling
 * pkg_action_upgrade_all() calls pkg_action_upgrade() just like pkg_action_install() does
